# PromptEngineerMCP

PromptEngineerMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that refines and enhances user prompts for cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs). It uses a locally run LLM to add details, instructions, and guardrailsâ€”ensuring optimal performance from your cloud LLM.

## Description

"PromptEngineerMCP: Enhances LLM prompts with local refinement, adding details and guidance for optimal cloud-based LLM performance."

## Features

- Takes plain user prompts and transforms them into detailed, well-structured inputs.
- Adds custom instructions, warnings, and context using a local LLM.
- Lightweight server design for easy integration with cloud-based LLMs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/admica/PromptEngineerMCP.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PromptEngineerMCP
   ```
4. Configure your local LLM (e.g., specify model path or API in `config.json`).

5. Update the config.json to include your URL to reach the local LLM, and your tech stack.

## Usage

1. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
2. Send a prompt via API or CLI:
   ```bash
   "Write a story about time travel."
   ```
3. Receive an enhanced prompt, e.g.:
   ```json
   {
     "refined_prompt": "Generate a React 19.1 component with TypeScript 5.4.3 using shadcn/ui
     for a web application built with Vite 5.2.6 that displays a chronological timeline of events
     from a user-provided text input describing a time traveler's journey. The timeline should
     render as a horizontal scrollable list of cards, each card representing an event with a
     title and short description. Implement Zustand 4.5.2 for state management to store the parsed
     events. The component should handle empty input gracefully by displaying a placeholder message.
     Include error handling for invalid text input formats, displaying user-friendly messages.
     Persist the timeline data in PostgreSQL 17.4 using Node.js 21.7.1 and TailwindCSS 4.1.1 for
     styling. The time traveler's journey should be parsed into events based on date/time markers
     within the input text; assume a simple 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. Allow users to filter the timeline
     by year using a dropdown menu, dynamically updating the displayed events."
   }
   ```
